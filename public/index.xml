      <description>Or, “An adaptation of monadology to include free will”&#xA;Leibniz’s theory of monadology has a number of interesting properties. It is an elegant conception of a universe constructed out of unchanging and indivisible structures called “monads”. However, its deterministic nature, while allowing for Leibniz’s compatibilist conception of free will, is contradictory to a libertarian conception of human free will as independent and unpredictable.&#xA;In this essay, I will attempt to resolve these contradictions and adapt monadology to include libertarian free will, by positing the unpredictability of free will as the influence of an unknown ‘black box’ inside the monad.</description>

      <description>In lieu of a CV, I have included my personal essays from an application to Harvard Precollege Summer school, as they are a fair indication of my personality and experience. They roughly cover the same range that a CV and interview would, and are thus given as an ersatz-CV. There may also be non-personal essays of mine posted elsewhere on the site, if that is of interest. Essays&#xA;Harvard Summer School High School Program Application Caspar Felten Jan 2024 Essays Instructions: Because we are interested in how you think and how you write, application essays must be your (the applicant&amp;rsquo;s) own words.</description>
